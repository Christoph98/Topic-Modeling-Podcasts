# Topic Modeling Podcasts

As Podcasts are becoming bigger and bigger, it is increasingly more important to understand them. One such way to understand them is by figuring out the categories that are talked about. In this project I intend to find topics of discussion in a podcast through self-transcribed snippets and topic modelling (using Latent Dirichlet Allocation).

Please Note: This project was prematurely halted, due to poor audio transcription quality. In light of Spotify giving me access to their Podcast Dataset, there is a new project I have in the works!

Thank you for your time!
