how's the words are caught in which he they use my friends the editor crystalline chris i don't always see i'd ion one shooter shooting going to the article but i can tell you what we both agree on one questioning it's been an article that i wrote you doing cocaine we fuel core progress to chris horn told got those are recorded in what is that well basically switch grass is one of the feedstock for a bio fuel and down the course it's something that pops up in the news all the time the south ethanol or bio diesel alone but instead of using corn out which is something of course that that people and animals eat or a sugar cane 'em look to the wishes so yes yes absolutely on the very hard to find a mcconnell us sure i'm we can use which grass which is a great source of us tell us which is that the substance of levy told me on that cell walls are made out of tune them basically what they do is to break it down and make it into a fuel to slinky refined oil in the gasoline it except uganda terrified fossil fuels a city where we're at now possibly approaching peak oil as you mentioned in another one of your calls and down so this is something that that might be outgrown all over the world then lost it aren't good enough for crops on him i'd be really good solution would only that those which this is the wonderful frigo be able to improve so we're grows so would you say negroes in these in marginal stroble inflicted be used for former u. it it actually improves the soil so you gruesome swifter as an area for about a dozen years and next thing you know preston finger

ornamental grass sometimes are but dingell's millions clearly put on the earth years abuses as though you're sick ethanol was was that scared so one interpretation of it and it'll be interesting to to see what happens with it because i'm right now it's very expensive for finds which pressed into surrealistic ethanol a man of course every proponents every different bio fuel has a reason why we should be using the years alone but one thing josh that found out recently sense we published article is that conferring fields to be used for bio fuels of for example to grow soy or corn or sugar cane or palm or pom pom can actually be more trouble because in the conversion process it releases carbon outside into the atmosphere i read an article in the new scientists at ten thousand square meters of drizzling rain forests i can bring them over to grow by a few all-star crops on that one actually really seven hundred thousand kilograms of car not say which is amazing you're you're have to use bio fuels for years hundreds of years and in some cases to recoup the car and get the chief u. by converting it so it seems like swish press my idea great solution of swift this is an excellent solution but i don't think it's the only solution i you know you degrees which grants in tunisia you can go home invasion may glow from it and sure you know there's a car been detonated something clearly that we're trying to get around is it put any more carbon ernie other greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere but i think even more than even know maybe more important than the climate
